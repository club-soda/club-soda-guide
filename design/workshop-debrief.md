# Workshop Debrief

## End Goal
We determined the bigger picture goal - the underlying why to be:
> “Change the societal relationship to drinking culture”
Lofty heights admittedly, however the journey to satisfaction is plotted out as follows:
- Change drinking habits
- Change drink vendor habits
- Create equality and respect for all patrons, alcoholic or non
*nb: finishing slightly ahead of time (progress over pedantry) allowed us to invite another team member to sense check everything and formulate the goals in her own words.*

## Focus for Mini-Sprint
The focus for the next few days is to help:
1. The Piqued Drinker
(it’s important to distinguish that we’re not going after the average person - we’re going for the low-hanging-fruit)
 - This person is aware of club soda enough to visit the website
 - They may not know that low and non alcoholic drinking is as populous as it is or at all
 - They have expectations about what alcohol free drinking means which may be societally imposed
 - Some may have had experiences at bars and pubs in which they were made to feel unwelcome for their decision to order alcohol free
2. Discover drinks and venues
The emphasis here is on inverting expectations and inviting curious exploration.
Reliability of the site is important as is
Trustworthiness.
I am operating on the hypothesis that a **reassured** and **empowered** visitor to the website (i.e. by words and images present a subversive message) will be curious enough to click through.

This person’s journey ultimately leads them in one of two directions:
 1. Visiting a venue
 2. Purchasing a drink online

> Note on testing - and the focus point being the drink and venue discovery:
*How do people want to discover drinks?*
(Various options explored in solution sketches)
 - featured | similar to | flavours
 - alcoholic equivalent “is like” | ABV | Sold at (shops) | Ingredients
 - by social score / popularity
> my initial thoughts on this are that detailed filtering would only be required by the discerning visitor - rather, a person that has made a search request or entered through the side-door (a brand/venue page). Therefore these options like filtering by ABV etc should be on a list of results - not at the point of discovery.
My recommendation would be “discovery” is done through clicks or through a search.

## Solutions
#### Themes
Curiosity
Community
The right choice for me
Safe space
Empowerment

#### Language and Tone
There was an interesting focus on tone and language. Some stand out phrases from the solutions which gained votes are as follows:
> Be Spoilt for Choice
> Social Hotspots
> Reclaim Your Night Life

#### Imagery
Graphics were used generally to emphasise either the breadth of the options or the importance of the community in making all of this possible.
 - Revelry amongst friends - one solution suggested some promoted or popular drinks via an interactive graphic of drinking patrons.
 - Cheering community
*Addressing the dissatisfaction with the state of drinking culture did not seem to capture the imaginations - perhaps the message itself is to dour and doesn’t prompt positive action.*

#### Synthesis
An absolutely democratic solution based on the cast votes is a combination of the

following things:
[Graphic] - diverse people enjoying themselves and holding drinks which are labelled low/
non alcohol
[Graphic] - bottle caps representing the range of brands fill the screen - one bottle cap
floats above the rest: it is a call to action
[Graphic] - cheering people labelled “venues, consumers, makers”
[UI] - discovery options hierarchically: Drink trends | Social Hotspots | Inspiring Ideas |
What’s missing
the last option here is an invitation to update the site with unlisted drinks, venues and
reviews: an open call to the visitor to be part of this community made enterprise of
mindful drinkers: the Soda Club.
