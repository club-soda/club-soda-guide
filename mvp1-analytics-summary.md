2018 for the Club Soda Guide MVP 1.0.

### When

#### Geographic Breakdown
- 3/4 of users were in the UK.
- 40% of users were in London.
- After London the most popular city was Edinburgh where 2% of activity was
detected.

### User Behaviours
- Average session duration: 2mins 11sec
- Bounce rate 62%
- Average of 2.78 pages per session
- Average of 1.33 sessions per user
- The most viewed page was the landing page which accounted for 27% of page views
- Following this came search results which were viewed 6311 times (10% of page views)
- And 3rd most popular was the Mindful Pub Crawl page which could be accessed
via a link directed at 'customers' from the landing page. It accounted for 5% of
page views.
- The 'add your venue page' was viewed 847 times in comparison to the 'nominate a venue' page which was viewed 67 times. So for this stage of the project by page views alone it would appear that venues were more likely to add themselves than be added by a customer.

#### Search results
The search bar could be seen when you scrolled down the landing page and it looked like this:

![Club Soda Guide Search Bar](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16775804/46158334-8ef23400-c275-11e8-8815-6ef296664671.png)
- London was the most popular 'near' search term with 334 searches (with no 'search for' specified).
- The second most popular search was an empty search which was performed 113 times with no search terms.
- The most searched term under 'search for' was 'All bar one' which received 31 searches.

The search terms used might suggest the need for some revision of the UX to help people understand it's functionality more to tailor searches to their needs. A glance at the search queries suggests that more people were searching by location than using the 'search for' box which may suggest a lack of understanding to what 'search for' meant or perhaps that people most wanted to search by location. As a key part of the functionality it would probably be useful to set up some more in-depth analytics around the use of the search for MVP 2.0.

### Learnings for MVP 2.0

These findings are likely to resonate most with the Club Soda team. The team may be able to draw more insight from the findings e.g. key dates and locations of activity. However to benefit the most from analytics it would be advisable to set out some key metrics for MVP 2.0. There were no goals set on the Google Analytics for the first MVP and the raw data alone doesn't seem to help inform the next MVP clearly as it lacks structure/direction.

The first MVP site has a very different look and flow to the new one so there may not be many transferable learnings. It may be useful to try and improve upon baseline statistics such as the bounce rate. It would be worth considering the greater popularity of venues signing themselves up as opposed to customers doing so for MVP 2.0. Also there may be some learnings to take from the search bar functionality.

*Based on 58% of total users (Google Analytics did not have data on these
variables for all users)
