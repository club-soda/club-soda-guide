# Club Soda Guide
Mindful Drinking Movement - Club Soda MVP 2.0

### [Design Documents](/design)

## Why?

The Club Soda Guide has been created to help **make a world where nobody has to
feel out of place if they're not drinking**.

## Who?

The guide is for anyone who wishes not to drink, whether that's a little or all
of the time. We call this mindful drinking. This group of people we have broadly
called consumers, however there are many subsets of consumers that we will delve
into in more detail in the future.

To help provide mindful drinkers with information on low / non alcoholic drinks
and places where they can enjoy them we are also focussing on drink brand
representatives and venue managers. Not forgetting, the team at CS HQ who will
run and maintain the site.

Here are the user personas for these groups:

![Persona, Nisha the Consumer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16775804/46004041-d5933300-c0a9-11e8-9c97-c7ea0ad38d9e.png "Persona, Nisha the Consumer")

![Persona, Bradley the Brand Manager](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16775804/46004238-49354000-c0aa-11e8-801b-858d137f6b1b.png "Persona, Bradley the Brand Manager")

![Persona, Vicky the Venue Manager](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16775804/46004426-cb256900-c0aa-11e8-8faa-31878125a4d4.png "Persona, Vicky the Venue Manager")

![Persona, Jussi from Club Soda](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16775804/46004730-7c2c0380-c0ab-11e8-96b1-267bdc416001.png "Persona, Jussi from Club Soda")

## What?

The site acts as a place of discovery for consumers to find low / non alcoholic
drinks and venues that serve them. It will also provide brands and venues with
the opportunity to connect and understand their consumers better. We hope this
will drive a community that owns the mindful drinking movement.

## User Guide

In the current iteration of the app, users can sign up and add their venue.

To sign up, visit https://club-soda-guide.herokuapp.com/users/new, or click on the 'List a Venue' button on the top left of any page.

(These pages are still undergoing work so do not currently look very nice, but are functional).
